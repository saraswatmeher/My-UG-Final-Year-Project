AuNP are promising for cancer detection and photothermal therapy (PTT) due to their optical properties. They enhance imaging techniques for early diagnosis and selectively destroy cancer cells by converting near-infrared (NIR) light into heat. Surface modifications improve targeting, making AuNPs a potential tool in cancer treatment.
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have gained significant attention in cancer detection and treatment due to their unique optical and thermal properties. Their strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) allows for sensitive detection of cancer cells using techniques like UV-Vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence imaging. Functionalized AuNPs improve biocompatibility and enable targeted delivery, reducing side effects on healthy tissues.

In cancer detection, AuNPs enhance imaging techniques by improving contrast and signal intensity, making early-stage diagnosis more effective. Their ability to bind with biomolecules enables specific identification of cancer markers.

For photothermal therapy (PTT), AuNPs efficiently absorb near-infrared (NIR) light and convert it into heat, selectively destroying cancer cells while minimizing harm to surrounding healthy tissues. This method provides a non-invasive treatment approach with high precision.

Ongoing research focuses on optimizing AuNPs in terms of size, shape, stability, and surface modifications to enhance their effectiveness in biomedical applications. With continued advancements, AuNPs hold great potential for improving cancer diagnosis and treatment.
