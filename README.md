AuNP are promising for cancer detection and photothermal therapy (PTT) due to their optical properties. They enhance imaging techniques for early diagnosis and selectively destroy cancer cells by converting near-infrared (NIR) light into heat. Surface modifications improve targeting, making AuNPs a potential tool in cancer treatment.
